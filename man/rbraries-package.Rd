\title{Interface to the libraries.io API}
\description{
Client for the libraries.io API, a platform for "helping
you find new open source libraries, modules and frameworks
and keep track of ones you depend upon."
}
\section{Auth}{

You need an API key to use this package. Get one by logging in to
Libraries.io (they have GitHub login and others), then go to your
Settings page, then scroll down to API key section and grab your
key.

You can pass the key into function calls, but that's not recommended.
Store your key by putting a \code{LIBRARIES_IO_KEY} entry in your .Renviron
file or similar file like e.g. .zshrc or .bash_profile, etc. We'll grab
that key so that you don't have to pass it into each function call.
